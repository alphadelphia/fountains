# React-boilerplate

Here is a one starting point for a React project.

Besides React, it has Express, Webpack, Mocha and React Router v4.

A (very!) bare-bones app has been provided in the app directory.
There is one sample test that I copied from https://survivejs.com/webpack/techniques/testing/

To install
```
yarn install
```
To run the express server,
```
node server.js
```
To run webpack
```
yarn run webpack
```
To run tests, 
```
yarn run test:mocha
```
Add `--watch` to the above to run the tests as you modify the code.

**Please note!** When you change the name of the project from React-boilerplate to something else, remember also to edit the project name in package.json!
